# TEMPERATURE-AND-HUMIDITY-MEASURING-SYSTEM-USING-IOT-
THE PROJECT IS BASED ON SIMPLE CONCEPT OF ARDUINO

Measuring temperature is one of the most common technique used because it is important for many operations and tasks
to be performed like in any industries where heaters are used, heat up to a certain temperature is required. 
When it comes to sensing temperature, a temperature sensor is used that is installed at a place whose temperature is to be sensed. 
The temperature of that place can be monitored through internet using internet of things.

COMPONENTS:
1.ESP8266 WIFI MODULE
2. HUMIDITY MEASURING SENSOR
3. ARDUINO
